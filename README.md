 ## SQL Data Analysis Project
In this data analysis project by CareerFoundry, I use PostgreSQL in conjunction with Tableau to answer business questions for a fictitious DVD rental company, Rockbuster Stealth. This repository contains the following:
- Moderately complex SQL queries to answer business questions.
- SQL results presented to stakeholders by creating visualizations and telling a data story.
- SQL results presented to technical colleagues using Microsoft Excel and creating a data dictionary.

## Data
The DVD rental database represents the business processes of a DVD rental store. Descriptions and Entity Relationship Diagram can be found in the Data Dictionary file.
