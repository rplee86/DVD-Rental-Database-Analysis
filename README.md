 ## SQL Data Analysis Project
In this data analysis project, I use PostgreSQL in conjunction with Tableau to answer business questions for a fictitious DVD rental company, Rockbuster Stealth, in service of applying my data analytics skills learned from [CareerFoundry](https://careerfoundry.com/). This repository contains the following:
- Data dictionary
- SQL queries to answer business questions.
- An entity relationship diagram (ERD) made with [DbVisualizer](https://www.dbvis.com/).
- Results presented to stakeholders in the form of a story board. Link to my [Tableau Storyboard Presentation](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ryan.lee1243/viz/CareerFoundryExercise3_10_16891997793630/RockbusterPresentation?publish=yes).

## Data
The DVD rental database represents the business processes of a DVD rental store. Descriptions and Entity Relationship Diagram can be found in the Data Dictionary file.
Here is the link to the [PostgreSQL DVD Rental sample database](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dvdrental.zip).
