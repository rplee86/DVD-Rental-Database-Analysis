 ## SQL Data Analytics Project
In this data analytics project, I use PostgreSQL in conjunction with Tableau to answer business questions for a fictitious DVD rental company, Rockbuster Stealth, in service of applying my data analytics skills learned from [CareerFoundry](https://careerfoundry.com/). This repository contains the following:
- Project brief, fabricated for the purpose of learning
- Data dictionary
- SQL queries to answer business questions
- An entity relationship diagram (ERD) made with [DbVisualizer](https://www.dbvis.com/)

## Data
The DVD rental database represents the business processes of a DVD rental store. Descriptions and Entity Relationship Diagram can be found in the Data Dictionary file.
Here is the link to the [PostgreSQL DVD Rental sample database](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dvdrental.zip).
